Iot project robotic Arm

This robotic arm is controlled by 2 analog joysticks, which allwos the user to contol the robotic arm. This robotic arm consists of four servo motors to control the direction of the robrotic arm, there is also a built-in featue that you can contol the robotic arm with a mobile phone or tablet.The built-in feature  allows the user to control to robotic arm at far distances. I have used arduino IDE to progam the Esp32.The robotic arm   consists of 4 servo motors to provide precise movements which is essential for controlling the robtic arm.
